Moien alleguer! Today marks the beginning of the Shogi Luxembourg project, with its main focus of creating a strong community here in Luxembourg! To the casual and hardcore player, we hope that providing a central hub for all Luxembourg Shogi players will to introduce a more professional organisation around the game and aid in communicating about events (online and offline) that may be of interest. The community is now in its early stages, but we hope to see this project evolve in the coming months. If you are interested in interacting more, please check out the <strong>community</strong> tab and share with anyone who would also be interested!
