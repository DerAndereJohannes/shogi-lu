## Introduction
Shogi is the Japanese version of chess. The main difference between chess and shogi is the concept of reusing the pieces that you capture from the opponent. The game, while very popular in Japan, has also seen an uptick in popularity in Europe and the Americas. This website / Association was created to find interested participants in Luxembourg and surrounding areas in order to develop a Luxembourgish shogi community.
